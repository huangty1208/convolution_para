  Introduction:

  This digital convolution algorithm replace each element in a  multi-dimensional grid by a weighted sum of its neighbors. The serial code is written in C and parallelized with OpenMP. Two 2D arrays (x, y) were defined. (x) was Initialized with random numbers between 0 and 1. The elements of the second array (y) were derived from (x) by smoothing over the elements using the constants a, b and c. We then counted the elements that are smaller than a threshold t in both arrays and print the number for both arrays. 


  note: 

  Data was allocated on the heap:

  All are subroutine /void function calls 

  All information through subprogram parameters 

  No global variables 

  Compiled with the flags-O2 -xHost â€“qopenmp

  Tests were run using dynamic and  static scheduling with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64threads
